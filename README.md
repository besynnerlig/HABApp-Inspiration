Welcome to the HABApp-Inspiration repository! This repository provides a collection of HABApp scripts for the OpenHAB environment, designed to inspire and guide you in creating your own custom automation solutions.

## What is HABApp?

HABApp is a powerful Python library that extends the functionality of OpenHAB by enabling you to write automation scripts in Python. It offers flexibility and intuitive interaction with OpenHAB items, event handling, rule creation, and more.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to express my gratitude to the creators and maintainers of the following projects:

- [HABApp](https://habapp.readthedocs.io/): HABApp was developed and is maintained by Sebastian, a.k.a [@Spaceman_Spiff](https://community.openhab.org/u/spaceman_spiff/summary) who have made it possible to write Python automation scripts for OpenHAB.

- [OpenHAB](https://www.openhab.org/): OpenHAB is an open-source home automation platform that provides a flexible and powerful environment for managing and controlling various smart devices.

Without the hard work and dedication of the developers behind HABApp and OpenHAB, this repository would not be possible. I extend my sincere appreciation to them.

## Getting Started

To get started, make sure you have OpenHAB and HABApp set up and running in your environment. You can find the installation instructions in the official documentation:

- OpenHAB: [https://www.openhab.org/docs/](https://www.openhab.org/docs/)
- HABApp: [https://habapp.readthedocs.io/](https://habapp.readthedocs.io/)

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized based on the structure seen from the OpenHAB directory where `habapp? is a sub folder. Explore the directories below to find examples related to different aspects of home automation:

- `habapp/config`: Configuration files and settings related to your HABApp setup.

- `habapp/lib`: Additional libraries, modules, or dependencies used in conjunction with HABApp.

- `habapp/param`: Parameter files or configurations specific to your HABApp scripts.

- `habapp/rules`: Examples of rule configurations using HABApp. You'll find scripts demonstrating how to create rules, define triggers, and perform actions based on events.

- `items`: Examples related to OpenHAB items.

Feel free to navigate through the directories, explore the individual Python files, and adapt the code to suit your specific requirements. Review the code comments and README files within each directory for additional instructions, explanations, or any prerequisites for running the scripts.

These examples are meant to inspire you and serve as starting points for your own HABApp scripts. Let your creativity guide you as you build your custom home automation solutions!

## Using the Scripts

To use the scripts in this repository, navigate to the directory of your choice and explore the individual Python files. Each file represents a self-contained example or a specific functionality. Feel free to modify, adapt, and experiment with the code to suit your requirements.

Review the code comments and README files within each directory for additional instructions, explanations, or any prerequisites for running the scripts.
